A visual detection alone is an unconfirmed diagnostic observation. GPS, timestamps and sensor readings must be correlated; an image confidence score alone does not prove that a mine is present. The SRS Version-2 metal detector has approximately 1 cm range, requiring a separate close-range confirmation step. The sample flight altitude does not establish metal sensing at that altitude.' },

The application route planner uses recorded point evidence and does not assess ground traversability, buildings, unknown hazards or physical clearance.
